# Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).


## Prerequisites ✅

Before starting make sure your development environment is properly set. See [Volto Developer Documentation](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/index.html#install-plone).

-   An [operating system](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#prerequisites-for-installation) that runs all the requirements mentioned.
-   [nvm](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#nvm)
-   [Node.js and pnpm](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#node-js) 22
-   [Make](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#make)
-   [Git](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#git)
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (optional)

make install
```

## Start developing

Start the backend.

```shell
make backend-docker-start
```

In a separate terminal session, start the frontend.

```shell
make start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000

You can access the source code

```shell
cd packages/volto-social-sharing/
```

and Happy hacking!

## Lint code

Run ESlint, Prettier, and Stylelint in analyze mode.

```shell
make lint
```

## Format code

Run ESlint, Prettier, and Stylelint in fix mode.

```shell
make i18n
```

## Unit tests

```shell
make test
```

## Run Cypress tests

Run each of these steps in separate terminal sessions.

In the first session, start the frontend in development mode.

```shell
make acceptance-frontend-dev-start
```

In the second session, start the backend acceptance server.

```shell
make acceptance-backend-start
```

In the third session, start the Cypress interactive test runner.

```shell
